#2022-01-20

This is the 2022 reboot of labbuilder.

Restating our goals. 

1) create code to extract **configuration only** dumps from our Red Hat technologies 
2) create code to consume the configuration dumps to allow us to recreate complex environments
3) start with Red Hat Identity Management, Satellite and Ansible Automation Platform - the enterprise service and construction backplane. 4) extend to other infrastucture planes such as container platform and virtualization, storage infrastucture, etc..

Binary bootstrap model. 
Use ansible locally to create and configure an IdM server
Use ansible locally to create a Satellite server
Use ansible locally to create have Satellite provision an AAP controller server and then use ansible locally to configure AAP
Use tower to run workflows to create additional infrastructure.
- IdM replicas
- Satellite capsules
- AAP controller cluster
- OpenShift clusters

- configure remote-execution
- add ansible roles to Satellite
- add ansible variables to Satellite
- create host groups
- add SCAP content to Satellite
- add tailoring files
- create SCAP policies

- create Tower server
- configure tower
- configure tower example jobs
