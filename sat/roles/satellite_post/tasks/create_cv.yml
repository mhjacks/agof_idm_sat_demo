# This play creates an individual content view from specified paramters
# Call this with a dictionary defining the content-view.
#
# Specify the list as cvs_mandatory or cvs_optional in the vars file
#
# We ARE NOT using auto-publish for composites as we will control that 
# through the monthly content configuration with Tower
#
# Creating the content view is many layered: 
# - create the view
# - add the repositories
# - add the filters
# - add any ansible content
#
# This is one reason why I decided on looping in task calls defined in other files...
